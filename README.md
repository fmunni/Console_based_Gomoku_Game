This is a console-based Java application to play Omok
game or Tic-tac-toe game or Gomoku game.

Omok, meaning "five pieces", is a two-player strategy game
  typically played with go pieces, black and white stones, on a go board
  with nxn intersections (or places). It can also be played with a
  paper and pencils because stones, once placed, are not allowed to be
  moved or removed from the board. The two players alternate in placing
  a stone of their color on an empty intersection, and the goal of the
  game is to place one's stones in a row of five consecutive
  intersections vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The winer is
  the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones.

This application has the following functional and
non-functional requirements:

1. The game board consists of n*n intersections (or places) on which black/white
  stones is placed.
2. This application shows the progress of a game by displaying the current state
    of the board -- i.e., stones placed on the board -- along with other player's
    turn.
3. When the game ends, this application displays the outcomes of the game, i.e.
  a win or draw.
4. This application provides a user to quit the game, e.g., by
    using a special input value.
5. This application takes all user inputs from System.in and displays all outputs
    to System.out.
